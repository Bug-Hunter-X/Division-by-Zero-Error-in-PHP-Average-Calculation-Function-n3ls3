This repository contains a PHP function that calculates the average of an array of numbers.  The original function had a flaw: it didn't handle cases where the input array was empty or contained only zeros, resulting in a division by zero error. The updated code addresses this issue by explicitly checking for these conditions and returning 0.0 in those cases. This demonstrates proper error handling in PHP, a crucial aspect of robust code.
